# DecisionTree-Classification-in-Spark
Run a Decision Tree based Classification process in Pyspark and evaluate the model

This exercise is a part of Coursera's Big Data Specialisation in [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/big-data-machine-learning), offered by University of California, San Diego.

The data available in a CSV contains San Diego weather data collected over a period of three years. More information regarding the data capture can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/big-data-machine-learning/supplement/jYoxX/description-of-daily-weather-dataset). The idea is to classify a day as low-humid or high-humid day based on weather data in the morning. The results are compared against the afternoon sensor data.
